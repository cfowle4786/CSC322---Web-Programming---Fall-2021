        Greetings and welcome to my page for my fall semester of Web Programming

          Take the journey with me as we go on an adventure and learn the best
          way to make the best web pages that we can. This should be an
          entertaining and wild ride in which I will mess up and fix the same
          thing over and over again. So come with me as we learn about web
          programming.

          First and foremost I'm a dad. My little girl is my everything. She is
          a ten year old fire cracker of love and caring, even though she does
          drive me crazy most of the time. I have my mom who lives with me. She
          was diagnosed with heart failure 5 years ago and has had to have my
          help ever since. It's hectic at times but then again what family
          isn't.<br />
          <br />
          I've had alot of experience in my 33 years of age. I worked for the
          electric company for almost 9 years. It was an experience that I
          will cherish for the rest of my life. I learned many different skills
          during that time and made many different friends. I work for a call
          center currently and they are some of the best people that I have ever
          worked for.<br />
          <br />
          I'm currently enrolled in Sullivan University. I'm in my third year
          for my Bachelors Degree. I can't wait to see where everything I have
          learned will take me with my IT career. I currently fix computers on
          the side. Mainly only hardware stuff because the software still
          intimidates me. I hope to have my own fully-fledged business one day
          and can't wait to see where life takes me.

        <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/">W3Schools</a> - I abosolutely love
        this site. It has so much great informationt that is so helpful It can
        get you where you need to be in just about all aspects of code<br />
        <br />
        <a href="https://www.codecademy.com/">Codecademy</a> - This is another
        favorite of mine. It has so many different lessons that will help with
        any kind of programming that you may need. I don't really care for the
        fact that there is a paywall though to access the entire site.
